<!--
Skip the rest of this template only if your PR is tier-0:

Otherwise, fill out the sections below. See docs/ETHICS.md for the tier
rubric and the full 8-item checklist.

## Summary

<!-- What this PR does, in 1-3 sentences. -->

Closes #

## TDD evidence

<!-- For type:feat / type:fix only. Skip if tdd-tier:exempt or smoke. -->

- [ ] A failing `test(...)` commit precedes the first `feat(`/`fix(` commit
- [ ] The green commit carries a `Tdd-Red: <sha>` trailer (or `Tdd-Red-Verified: inline`)

## Ethics & UX checklist

<!--
Required items for the tier (see docs/ETHICS.md and the canonical source at
.claude/checklists/ethics.json). N/A is fine for non-required items with a
one-line reason.
-->

**1. Intent declared** *(required at every non-zero tier)*
> What behavior change does this PR push the user toward, and whose benefit?

**2. No deception, no coercion** *(required at tier 2)*

**3. Asymmetric persistence justified**

**4. Borrowed credibility honest**

**5. Emotional cues reciprocal**

**6. Surveillance overt and supportive** *(required at tier 2)*

**7. Vulnerable-group impact considered** *(required at every non-zero tier)*

**8. Unintended-but-predictable outcomes named** *(required at every non-zero tier)*

## Mechanical checks

- [ ] `npm run check` passes
- [ ] `npm run ux:check` passes *(tier-1+ PRs)*
- [ ] `npm run a11y` passes *(tier-2 PRs)*
